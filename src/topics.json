        "name": "Galileo Galilei",
        "descOne": "Birth Date: February 15, 1564 | Death Date: January 8, 1642 | Place of Birth: Pisa, Italy",
        "descTwo": "Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, mathematician, and philosopher. Galileo was the first of six children, and his father was a musician/scholar. During his teenage years, he attended the University of Pisa to study medicine, but was later sidetracked by mathematics. He ended up leaving without completing his degree.",
        "descThree": "Galileo has made some remarkable contributions to science, astronomy, and mathematics: Proved objects fall at the same speed regardless of shape/space. First developed the concept of Inertia, which helped Isaac Newton later with his findings. Galileo’s compasses were used by the military. He also discovered the rings of Saturn and the different Phases of Venus. His major improvements to the telescope allowed him to sight the four major moons of Jupiter along with various other stars.",
        "descFour": "Later in his life, Galileo became an advocate for heliocentrism and would teach about it whenever he can. This brought upon enemies among the Catholic Church Leaders, which eventually led to his house arrest sentencing. Galileo ended up spending the last 9 years of his life under house arrest, and passed away at the age of 77."

        "descOne": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger that maintains a growing list of ordered records called blocks. A block is simply a record of a new transaction that is added to the blockchain if it has been verified.",
        "descTwo": "Blockchain technology has five key properties: Decentralized meaning there is no single authority in control of the blockchain, public meaning anyone can access the blockchain, secure meaning no single authority could exploit the blockchain, consensus-model meaning transactions are legitimized by all participants of the blockchain, instantaneous meaning all transactions on the blockchain are carried out rather quickly relative to traditional systems.",
        "descThree": "Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. The block time for Ethereum is roughly 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.",
        "descFour": "Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography. A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain, and value tokens (cryptocurrencies) sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets and to other features of the blockchain."

        "descTwo": "Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author. Newton attended Trinity College to study law, but the school closed due to outbreaks of the plague. Shortly after came his newfound interest in mathematics. Fast forward to 1717, Isaac Newton held the position as master of the Royal Mint, and he established a new ratio between gold and silver which ultimately drove silver out of monetary circulation and put Britain on a Gold Standard.",
        "descThree": "Isaac Newton has numerous remarkable contributions in many fields: Newton’s Law of Motion was groundbreaking for the physics world, Newton’s Universal Gravitation Law, and Newton’s Principia (1687) which is considered one of the most important works in modern science as it solidified the belief of a heliocentric model and was pivotal in the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Newton also invented Calculus (yes, blame him for all your math trauma), and he invented the first reflecting telescope. Newton also identified light as the source of color sensation (color is a result of objects interacting with colored-light).",
        "descFour": "In March of 1727, Sir Isaac Newton experienced severe abdominal and back pain and blacked out. He later died in his sleep. Fun Fact: During his autopsy, traces of mercury were found in his hair, likely as a result of his late interest in alchemy. "

Individual cells range in size from 2 to 200 micrometers. Diatoms are mainly photosynthetic. With enough nutrients and sunlight, living diatoms can double approximately every 24 hours via asexual multiple fission. The maximum life span of a single diatom is roughly six days. ",

Orbiting far out in our Solar System, it is the 8th and farthest planet from the Sun. Due to Neptune’s absurd distance, it takes 4 hours for sunlight to reach the icy planet. Each season lasts roughly 40 years because of this.13 moons orbit the planet along with 6 hardly-visible rings around it. ",
        "descThree": "Neptune is the densest planet from all other giant planets in our solar system. The atmospheric contents of Neptune are hydrogen, helium, and methane. Although there is no potential for life as we know it. NASA’s Voyager 2 was the only spacecraft to reach Neptune, back in 1989. 80 percent of its mass comes from “icy” material: water, methane, and ammonia.",
