## About

The purpose of this project was to create a website that people can use to learn random things everyday. I love learning and reading about random things, and I love teaching people even more. So I figured why not build a website that displays information about random topics that come to my mind and share what I learn to the online world.

The information for each topic won't be overwhelming as I plan to keep it short and concise. I'm not trying to get you ready to write a five paragraph essay, but rather to try and teach you a little about something you probably didn't know about! :)

I'm learning on this journey too and I hope you guys stick around to learn with me! 

With that, I hope you enjoy the content provided and if you have any questions or recommendations, you can email me at the handle below.
